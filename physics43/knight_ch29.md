## Ch. 29.1: Magnetism
- A bar magnet floating in water will always align itself in an approximate north-south direction, creating a north (red) and a south (white) pole.
- Like poles repel, opposite poles attract.
- A compass needle is like a mini bar magnet. So the north pole of a bar magnel will attract one end of the compass needle and repel the other.
- Cutting a bar magnet in half (along the line dividing the poles) produces two weaker but still complete magnets, each with a north and a south pole. True no matter how many times you cut the magnet!
- Magnets can pick up some, but not all, objects. The most common magnetic material is iron. If an object is attracted to one end of a magnet, it's also attracted to the other end. 
- A magnet does not affect an electroscope (a device used to measure electricity).
- A charged rod exerts a weak attractive force (due to polarization) on both ends of a magnet (because it's a metal). Otherwise, charges have no effects on magnets!
- Magnetism $\neq$ electricity. It isn't a long-range force.

### Compasses and Geomagnetism
- The earth is a huge magnet due to currents in the molten iron core.
- The geographic north pole is the south magnetic pole.

## Ch. 29.2: The Discovery of the Magnetic Field
- In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current in a wire caused a nearby compass to turn. With no current, the compass needles point north. With a strong current, the compass needles are tangent to a circle around the wire. 
- The **right-hand rule** determines the orientation of the compass needles to the direction of the current:

- The magnetic field is revealed by the pattern of iron filings aroung a current-carrying wire.
- Vectors into a page are notated with an 'x'. Vectors out a page are notated with a dot.
- **Electric current causes a magnetic field.**

### The Magnetic Field

- The opposing forces and resultant torque on the needle cause it to become parallel to the magnetic field relative to the pivot point.
- The magnetic field is a vector $B$ (vector notation missing on LaTeX).
- The magnetic field at each point must be tangent to a circle around the wire. The field gets weaker further away from the wire.
	- **Magnetic field lines are circles.** A tangent to a field line is in the direction of the field. The lines are closer together where the magentic field strength is stronger.
- It might seem like there are two types of magnetism: those caused by permanent magnets and others caused by currents. In reality, all magentic effects are different aspects of a single magnetic force.

## Ch. 29.3: The Source of the Magnetic Field: Moving Charges
- The magnetic field of a charged particle $q$ moving with velocity $v$ is given by the **Biot-Savart law**: $$B_{point charge} = (\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{qvsin\theta}{r^2})$$
- The direction for the Biot-Savart law is give by the right-hand rule.

- $\mu_0$ is the permeability constant. $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} Tm/A$.
- The Biot-Savart law is an inverse-square law like Coulomb's law, but also depends on an angle $\theta$.
- $B = 0$ parallel to the line of motion (where $\theta = 0$ or $\theta = 180$).
- The SI unit of magnetic field strength is the tesla (T): 1 T = 1N/(Am).
- **All charges create electric fields, but only *moving* charges create magnetic fields.**

### Superposition and Cross Product
- Magnetic fields obey superposition!
- The cross product between vectors $C$ and $D$ is perpendicular to the plane produced by $C$ and $D$. Its magnitude is $CDsin\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle between the vectors.
